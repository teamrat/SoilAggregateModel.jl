Qualitative physics checks:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  POM: 1000.0 → 998.5 μg-C (99.9% remaining)
┌ Warning:   ⚠  POM not depleted enough after 60 months (expected <50%, got 99.9%)
└ @ Main ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Research/AGGREGATE/paper/simulations/single_aggregate_physics/run_simulations.jl:170
  r_agg: peak = 5.0 mm, final = 5.0 mm
┌ Warning:   ⚠  r_agg did not grow significantly above r_0
└ @ Main ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Research/AGGREGATE/paper/simulations/single_aggregate_physics/run_simulations.jl:185
  MAOC: 531.1 → 443.7 μg-C (-87.4 net increase)
┌ Warning:   ⚠  MAOC not accumulating much (expected continuous increase)
└ @ Main ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Research/AGGREGATE/paper/simulations/single_aggregate_physics/run_simulations.jl:193
┌ Warning:   ⚠  MAOC decoupling not clear (M_total ≈ M_agg at end)
└ @ Main ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Research/AGGREGATE/paper/simulations/single_aggregate_physics/run_simulations.jl:206
  CO₂ flux: peaks at 0.0 months
  ✓  CO₂ flux peaks reasonably early
┌ Warning:   ⚠  Radial profiles nearly flat (expected sharp C gradient near POM)
└ @ Main ~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Research/AGGREGATE/paper/simulations/single_aggregate_physics/run_simulations.jl:227
